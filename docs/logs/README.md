# Logs

This folder is for storing example or significant logs for posterity or
subsequent reference.  For example, showing how a process worked at a
given point in time, or in order to help triage a reported issue, etc.

It's expected the files in this directory are ephemeral; that is, their
value is time-sensitive: given the evolution of the software, they will
likely quickly become deprecated and irrelevant.
