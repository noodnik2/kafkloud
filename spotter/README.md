# `spotter`

ChatGPT said:
- _During the war, the role of an individual who was on the lookout
for army aircraft was commonly referred to as a "spotter" or an "aircraft spotter".
These individuals were responsible for watching the skies and reporting any sightings
of enemy aircraft to military authorities, which would then allow for a rapid response
to any potential threats. This role was particularly important during World War II when
air raids were a common form of attack."_

## The Idea

The idea is to use `spotter` to gather "near real-time" aviation data and send
it to `streamer` for interpretation an interesting ways by a `consumer`.

Not sure where this might eventually lead, but it seems like an interesting avenue
of exploration...
